# Optimization Problem: Locating Shopping Centers in Spain

## Overview
This repository contains Python code developed to address an optimization problem related to the strategic placement of shopping centers based on the populations of major Spanish localities. The project was part of a brief assignment where we were tasked with creating an optimization algorithm to determine the optimal number of shopping centers while adhering to specific constraints.

## Algorithm
The implemented algorithm is a combination of simulated annealing and other optimization strategies. We explored various approaches to achieve the best results, considering factors such as population distribution, geographical constraints, and minimizing the overall number of shopping centers.

## Language
The project and code were developed in Spanish as it was the language of instruction for the course. The README is in English for broader accessibility.
